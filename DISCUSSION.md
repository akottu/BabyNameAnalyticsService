### What pieces of code help versus obscure your understanding?
My naming conventions seem to be somewhat descriptive when it comes to understanding what each variable is and does.
However, I tend to create long lines of calling methods upon each other, which can be somewhat confusing.

### What names in the code are helpful and what makes other names less useful?
It seems like the longer names are actually more descriptive but can be hard to read every time because they are so
verbose.

### What additional methods might be helpful to make the code more readable or usable?
I need to start refactoring my nested loops into child methods, so that the parent method becomes more readable.

### What assumptions does this code have?
This code certainly assumes a lot of inputs to be convenient for it, and I imagine that the final part of this coding
project will actually help us think about all the variations in wrong inputs that could occur.

### What comments might be helpful within the code?
I think there will be a big benefit in commenting in such a way that I include a numbering system to know which prompt I
am writing a method for.

### What Code Smells did you find?
I should extract my for loops into methods so as to not have too much nested code, which can create smelly code. I also
should be making methods for more general cases, so that those methods can get reused for different test cases.
